<h3 style="font-size:40px; color:burlywood">Our journey</h3>
<p style=" font-size:25px">Founded in July 2020 in Bengaluru, Vevents was conceptualized to facilitate the growing demand for a comprehensive virtual event platform for event organizers - at the time the existing platforms were riddled with issues of scalability, customizations, affordability and other event-related bottlenecks.

  Taking the above into consideration, the Vevents team set out to solve all the issues of an eventâ€™s lifecycle. Thus, Vevents was born. </p>
